Based on your description, you're building what is a unix-style executable. On OS X, those will always launch inside of a terminal window. The choices that you have on OS X are:

Run as a daemon as described in the above-linked post
Run in Terminal as a unix executable
Create a minimal OS X application wrapper and run as an OS X Application
In most cases, you can create a wrapper for a unix-style executable by creating the appropriate Bundle using the instructions from Apple's Bundle Programming Guide (skip over the iOS stuff and look at the Mac bundle information).

The basic directory structure is:

MyApp.app/
  Contents/
    Info.plist
  MacOS/
    executable
  Resources/
    MyApp.icns
Your unmodified executable can go in the MacOS directory, and you'll need to set up the following keys in the Info.plist using a plist editing tool or editor:

CFBundleIdentifier - the id of your app in reverse-dns notation (com.mycompany.myapp)
CFBundleDisplayName - the name of your app in human-readable form (MyApp)
CFBundleName - the short name of the app (usually the same as your app and executable name)
CFBundleVersion - your version # in X.Y[.Z] form
CFBundlePackageType - the package type, which should be APPL for applications
CFBundleExecutable - the name of your executable
CFBundleSignature - old-school Apple signature (4 character code that should theoretically be registered with apple)
A minimal plist would look like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
    <string>MyApp</string>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
    <string>a.out</string>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
    <string>com.mycompany.myapp</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key>
    <string>MyApp</string>
    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
    <string>APPL</string>
    <key>CFBundleSignature</key>
    <string>FOOZ</string>
    <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
    <string>1.0</string>
</dict>
</plist>
(The above example uses a.out as the executable, which would be located in MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/a.out)

The icon resources can be left out if you don't care about the icon, and the default application icon will be used.
